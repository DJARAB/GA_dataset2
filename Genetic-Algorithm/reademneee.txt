Generation size:

    Too large: you're going to have a long epoch time, restricting how many chances each individual has to explore it's neighbourhood.
    Too small: you don't get good coverage of the search space.
Mutation rate:

    Too high: you risk the individuals "jumping" over a solution they were close to.
    Too low: they're all going to get stuck in local minima.
. Search terms: preselection, crowding, fitness sharing, incest prevention, overfitting, homogeneous


Principles borrowed from evolution–
Natural selection - survival of the fittest
• fit individuals produce more progeny

allele - each of two or more alternative forms of a gene that arise by mutation and are found at the same place on a chromosome.

Crossover in its simplest form (one-point crossover) is easily defined: Two chromosomes are lined up, a point along the chromosome is randomly selected, then the pieces to the left of that point are exchanged between the chromosomes, producing a pair of offspring chromosomes. 


 GAs have
been shown to solve problems that were considered
intractable due to an excessively large search space
