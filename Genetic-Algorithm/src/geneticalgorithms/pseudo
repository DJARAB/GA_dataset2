starts
initialise pop 
  generate individuals with wildcards e.g. 01120 1
add the datatxt to the data array

compare the arrays and get the fitness of the current generation <---
Compare the arrays and find a match PER INDIVIDUAL IF MATCH FOUND BREAK
if peak fitness not reached 
start tournament selection
 start the crossover 
    Mutate pop
Review population repeat until conditions are met


RULES aka genes - can have as many of them as you want but they help you classify the 
entire problem 
You grab the data and compare it to the data if it matches break
and move to the next data
So you're essentially checking if the data can get classified


FITNESS FUNCTION
IF the first 5 bits match and the 6th does not then move to the next data :'(
